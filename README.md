#### Key points

- Section 3 - Dervie optimisation parameter is conditionally modified NOT to execute as this section would take atleast 20 minutes to run.
- The above section of code was used to identify the right activation and optimsation parameters
- If you want to execute, the "CHECK" variable need to be modifed as "yes" to execute this part of the code
